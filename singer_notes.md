===================================================

1. I still think that the hypotheses mentioned in Experiments 1 and 2 should appear at the end of the introduction in a separate section. *Addressed by moving hypotheses from Experiment 1 introduction to the Introduction section*

1. I also think that the hypotheses should have some explicit theoretical grounding and not just somehow refer vaguely to the literature review. *Nori and myself agreed to ignore this*.

1. FInally the questionnaire was administered several times to the same participants.
 This introduces a number of biases which I believe can be assessed by the Sheffe test... but you know better than I do! *Nori and myself agreed to ignore this*

1. What is missing in the research targets section is hypotheses.
Please discuss with Nori.
If you intend to test evolutionary assumptions in a party situation, you need to say so.
And what if you don't find 'correlations' [are you sure you mean that, and not 'associations'?]???
