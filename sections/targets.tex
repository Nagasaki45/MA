\section{Research targets}

\new{In this research I will focus on two main targets:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To propose and implement an audio-only augmented reality system for social interaction. \new{Using the system, participants will be able to interact with one another as well as with system's components and affect the structure of the music in the virtual space.} \st{This system will let a user hear music generated by his or her physical location in space. In addition, the social interaction between users will affect the musical structure of the space in real time. As a development over mobile social interactive ideas like flash mobs and silent disco, the system will be developed for Android OS. Relative positioning in space will be determined using Bluetooth technology. Music will be created especially for the system and will be heard through headphones by the users.}
	\item \new{To evaluate the social effects of the system usage }\new{\st{on participants}}\new{ in the context of a silent rave party. }\st{In addition, I will apply different methods for system evaluation such as questionnaires and participants positioning tracking during system usage. Using those methods it will be possible to gain better understanding of the user's social interaction using my system.}
\end{enumerate}
\st{More generally, my research explores the potential for a new way of music consumption through mobile devices, where the consumer's social interaction is the main influence over actually heard music. Finally, my research explores the ways in which this interactive mode of music consumption can create new musical materials.}
