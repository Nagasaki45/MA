\section{Research targets}

The system developed in this research is inspired by the concepts of IMS and intended for the average user. In this research I will focus on the two following targets:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To propose and implement an audio-only augmented reality system for social interaction.
	Using the system, participants will be able to interact with one another as well as with system's components and affect the structure of the music in a virtual space.
	\item To evaluate the social effects of the system usage in the context of a silent disco party mainly focusing thereby on the following research question: \emph{Does the system elaborate social interaction between participants in an interactive silent disco party?}
\end{enumerate}
