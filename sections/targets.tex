\section{Research targets}

In this research I will focus on the two following targets:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To propose and implement an audio-only augmented reality system for social interaction.
	Using the system, participants will be able to interact with one another as well as with system's components and affect the structure of the music in the virtual space.
	\item To evaluate the social effects of the system usage in the context of a silent rave party.
\end{enumerate}
