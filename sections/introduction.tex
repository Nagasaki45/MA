\section{Introduction and framework}

% not too long introduction with emphasis on locating this specific research between the relevant fields

In the past 60 years the development of new technology has fundamentally transformed music creation and consumption (\cite[\todo{what page?}]{winkler01}).
One of the results of these transformations is IMSs (IMS), a concept that faciliting new ways of music creation and blurring the traditional distinction between instrument design, composition and performance. (\cite{drummond09}).
In the recent years there are many attempts to provide IMS not only to the professional musicians but also directly accessible to the average user(\todo{ref}).

Another key concept with high relevance to my work is Augmented Reality (AR).
According to Azuma ``AR enhances a user's perception of and interaction with the real world'' (\cite*{azuma97}). This concept usually relates to the visual modality: ``AR systems integrate 3-D virtual objects into a 3-D real environment in real time'' (\cite{azuma97}). My work extend the definition of AR system from the visual to the auditory modality opening the door for more comprehensive experience of virtual environments.

In this work I will combine the concept of IMS with AR creating a system for real time social interaction for average user, using concurrent mobile technology.
