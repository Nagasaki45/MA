Shlomo Dubnov notes about the research proposal
===============================================

1. My main concern is that the proposal does not make a clear distinction between motivation / background on social aspects of music, and the technological and musical innovation specific to this project. I think it is important to position the work not as a musicological research, but as a new tool that addresses a specific emerging musical trend of group audio silent events by adding spatial interaction design.  Accordingly, it would help if the research target could make this distinction more explicit, may be also by moving more of the technical discussion to the research section.

2. I think that calling this work "IMS [and] intended for average user" is not specific or clear enough. The system, at least to my understanding, does not offer programming effects or synthesis tools like Max and similar. This is more of a playback system with spatial control of content delivery that is intended for group interaction in such space. Since Apple patented silent disco, this area is quite hot in music business, and I think it would help to contextualize it this way.

3. I'm sure there are many specific technical aspects that had to be solved, but the thesis only briefly mentions the two versions of the system without giving a musical justification. Tom actually gives a hint for a musical reason, which is keeping an open architecture for other musicians to use the system, but I do not think a non computer music reader would see this connection.

Response: Much more details added to the architecture decisions regarding libpd and ScenePlayerPlus in the ScenePlayerPlus section, emphasising the meaning of tightly-coupled and design and its consequences (see commit 7943b35)

4. Technically, it is not clear how the audio is delivered from the DJ / performing musical or playback system to the users. Does the app support audio streaming over bluetooth? Or is it intended to be paired with wireless headphones systems for silent disco, or some other app that handles the audio? I looked at the links to google play, but I do not have an android device to see what it does. Are there other ways or pointers to the system?

Response: The question has been generally answered by the response for (3).

5. Last but not least, I think the proposal puts to much emphasis on the survey that is supposed to validate usability of the system, but does not pose a specific musical hypothesis about the larger question of significance of silent music delivery, the group experience it creates and the importance of controlling spatial aspects of the listeners placement as a creative tool. From my previous experience with BIU music, there might be some (or even strong) opposition to considering DJ / disco type of music as a deserving topic for an academic study. I do not think there is a simple solution to this problem, unless you can suggest some experimental contemporary usage. Installation art is one such option. We could do a contemporary music concert like this if you wish, in which case the whole idea of integrating spatial design and listener movement could be artistically addressed.

6. There is also the formality about page limit that you are probably aware of.
